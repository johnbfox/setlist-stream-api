# Setlest Stream API

This api streams band setlists from twitter and serves them on a public API

## Running Locally

To run locally you must first sign up for a Twitter developer account.  To do so
visit [https://dev.twitter.com/]

Once you've made an account, you must acquire your api keys.  Open config/config.json
and replace the empty values with the appropriate ones for the api keys.

## The Phish Endpoint

The only endpoint built thus far is for Phish.  It will send a response containing the
setlist of the currently playing show.
